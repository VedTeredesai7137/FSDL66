   - 'Ticket' high cardinality â†’ drop.
2. Variables: 
   - 'Age' ~20% missing; 'Fare' right-skewed; 'Survived' imbalanced.
3. Correlations: 
   - 'Pclass' (-) and 'Fare' (+) vs Survived.
4. Interactions: 
   - Sex & Pclass â†’ huge survival difference.
5. Missing Values Heatmap: 
   - Missing 'Cabin' often lower-class passengers.

Skip/skim:
- Duplicates (few in Titanic).
- Constant columns (none here).
- Unsupported variable types (irrelevant).
- Extreme pairwise plots (overwhelming without a specific hypothesis).`
